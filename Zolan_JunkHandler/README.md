ESO Addon that will mark junk items as junk when picked up and
will sell all items marked as junk upon visiting a store.

You can find the settings in SETTINGS->Zolan's Addons.

Pretty straight forward stuff.

Thanks to:
  Garkin - This addon was completely 100% inspired by Garkin's Dustman
      Addon which is the gold standard in this type of thing.  I'm
      making my own just to add to my suite of addons and for the
      learning experience, but Garkin's addon was the first and is
      still totally amazing.
  The Arcane Scripters Guild - Can't list them all but I really
      appreciated their patience in helping me get a handle
      on how addon development worked.
