Replace your default inventory's list view with a more compact grid view! The default list view shows 11-12 items at a time (in my case), so it can become a pain to navigate your inventory.

Grid view sacrifices detailed information for more pictures. Sometimes you want the detailed information, so I've included a button at the bottom that will toggle the grid on and off.

*Features*:
* Grid view for your main inventory, your bank, your guild bank, your quest items, NPC's stores, AND the buyback screen!
* Toggle grid view on and off! Useful for when you need to scan with more information.
* Customizable grid size.
* Four default skins to choose from, with more available for download.
* Authors can submit their own skins for download. (See [Inventory Grid View Skin Template](http://www.esoui.com/downloads/info583-InventoryGridViewSkinTemplate.html) for details.)
* Offsets item tooltips so they do not cover up the grid (can be turned off).
* Set scale of item icon animation.
* Works with Research Assistant and Advanced Filters!

*Special thanks to*:
* Rushmik, Tonyleila - included extra skin choices
