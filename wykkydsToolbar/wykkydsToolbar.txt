I can only work with the tools; that I am given. If something breaks it is likely due to something ZOS did that I need; to adjust my code in response to. Give me time and I'll do it. I appologize for the; inconvenience that this will cause you but ultimately it's out of my hands.; We develop these addons in our free time. We have full time day jobs, also have wives,; kids and pets. We do not create addons for the purpose of being paid. However, tossing; us a few bones eases the stress and frustration after endless hours of "code grinding"; because it adds to that feeling of work "paying off". It also helps to say we make money; on this when the wives ask why we spend so much time doing it!; If you like what you see and want more of it, feel free to donate. Lack of donations will; certainly not stop us from doing what we do. However, a flood of donations would certainly; shift priorities; the choice is yours. Our primary hope is that you enjoy our work as much as we do.; Donations accepted via paypal: ecgroup.wykkyd-addons@ecgroup.us; Follow me on Twitter @:	@Ravalox; Please post bug reports and feature requests on ESOUI on the comments TAB; for this Add-On or email us directly at support@ecgroup.us; Thanks!;	Ravalox
